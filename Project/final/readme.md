  # Kitty Korner Games

  Kitty Korner Games is a website starring the cats Oreo, Stormy, and Mika. It allows you to play a two-player tic-tac-toe game and a 1 player yarn gathering game. You can play as the cat of your choice! Just use the radio buttons to decide or switch at anytime. To play tic-tac-toe, each player selects a cat and then player one starts. To play the yarn game, choose a cat and it will follow your mouse. Use the cat to try and push all of the balls of yarn into the box.
